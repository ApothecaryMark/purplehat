I'm Mark Cutter, sometimes known as Anthony Mark Cutter, the man in the purple hat.

With a passion for empowering others and a unique perspective shaped by lived experience, I wear many hats (sometimes including a literal purple one) in the disability and neurodiversity space.

As a disability advocate, I champion accessibility in transport, fight against hate crime, and advocate for fair disability benefits. I draw on my own journey with disability, neurodiversity, and mental health to inform my work as a speaker and writer, sharing insightful and relatable perspectives.

Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by training as a **counselling psychologist** at the Metanoia Institute, working with clients in low-cost settings.

Additionally, I'm pursuing **executive coaching certification**, specialising in neurodiversity, ADHD, and disability coaching. My unique blend of advocacy expertise, lived experience of physical disability, and psychological understanding sets me apart, allowing me to empower individuals and organisations to reach their full potential. I currently have vacancies for coaching clients at a relatively low cost, so if you are interested in working with me, please get in touch.

Beyond coaching, I offer **consultancy and speaking services** within the disability field. My diverse background and personal story bring depth and authenticity to my presentations and collaborations. If you're looking to engage a passionate and knowledgeable speaker or consultant, please get in touch.
