My lived experience is at the heart of my work. I have a particular interest in experiences of financial distress and trauma. I am a former social entrepreneur who had some experiences of success but some experiences of failure, too (which you may also have seen if you've Googled me).

The distress associated with these experiences, and the desire to understand them, led me to the field of psychology, but the route there was a multifaceted one. Throughout my studies in law, medical ethics, social science, psychoanalysis, and hypnotherapy, a common thread emerged: a drive to understand and address the challenges faced by individuals with disabilities, neurodiverse brains, and experiences of mental ill-health.

My entrepreneurial endeavours, with their share of lessons learned, have further enriched my perspective, and my personal experience with financial distress and its lasting impact continues to fuel my commitment to social justice. Today, I'm even spearheading research on the concept of "financial trauma," a topic deeply ingrained in my own story.

**I am Mark Cutter, and I'm here to guide and empower others on their individual journeys.** If you're looking for a collaborative partner who understands the complexities of disability, neurodiversity, and personal challenges, I invite you to connect. Let's turn possibilities into realities.
