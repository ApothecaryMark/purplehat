title: 'Disability and Accessible Travel: A Lived Experience Expertise Case Study'
order: 3

I have worked as an activist in the field of disability travel / accessible travel for many years, and recently I have been greatful for the opportunity to take more of a leadership role in the field having been appointed as the [Chair of Northernâ€™s Accessibility User Group (NAUG)](https://www.northernrailway.co.uk/news/northern-appoints-new-chair-train-operators-independent-accessibility-user-group "Press release: Northern Rail"). In addition to working with Northern in this role; I have been asked to chair the Rail Accessibility and Inclusion Forum for the North (RAIFN). RAIFN brings together all of the Train Operating Companies (ToC's) that connect people and places to the north, within the north and travel from the north. In both roles, I am able to bring my wholeself to the table: holding space for difficult conversations and facilitating dialogue between the rail industry and a diverse range of stakeholders. 

My own relationship with travel is complicated. When I was younger I was more independant, but in recent years I have become increasing reliant on other people. I no longer travel independently, and always travel with a <strike> carer </strike>  companion (I prefer "companion" to the word "carer", partly because it gives me mysterious Dr Who vibes, and partly because I not always as comfortable sitting with my vulnerability and dependence on others as I make out).

All aspects of disability profile are relevant to the conversation: physical disability, neurodiversity, mental illness/mental ill-health and financial trauma. As are all aspects of my wider training and lived experience: sometimes I am lawyer at the table, some times I am psychologist, some times I am coach, and some times I am a poet. All times: I am bringing my lens of lived experience in to the room. 

I was fortunate to have the opportunity to speak at Transport for the North's annual conference in 2024 (on a lunch time panel). You might find it interesting to watch / listen to the panel, to get understanding of my broad approach to inclusion.

When I Chair meetings, I like to begin with a code of values. I can think of so many times in the past where these things wrong, and where I made bad decisions, but from that learning I have drawn together five principles that underline the way I like to work caputured by the accronym **ROCCK** (pronouced: _rock_). NB: _I am planning to write this up in a formal way, but here is a breif summary of my ROCCK approach to meetings._

- **Respect**: It is important to treat everyone in the room with respect, and to acknowledge that we all come from different backgrounds and bring different lived experience and/or professional experience to the table. Even in the context of holding an organisation to account, it is important to avoid an "us and them" approach. Rather it is important to create a sense of mutality, and to acknowledge and appreciate the different perspectives in the room.

- **Openness**: There is nothing to be gained from a lack of transparency, or from a sense of needing to hide things in a meeting (or in any other setting). However we are only able to bring our wholeself to the room, and to share openly if we feel safe to do so (if we feel we will be treated with **respect** for doing so). Everyone in the room should be open: no hidden agendas, no attempts to hid mistakes. 

- **Curiosity**: Curiousity is a powerful tool, and rather than sitting with our own assumptions it is helpful to be curious about everything that happens in the room. Even if the content of a presentation seems familiar, we have an opportunity to be curious and interested and to notice new things in the material. If someone introduces something new that challenges us: curiousity is a powerful tool to help us overcome that challenge. It helps us learn more rather than shutting down or rejecting an idea, and allows us to be more accepting and inclusive of other perspectives.

- **Compassion**: Compassion is a hugely important value, and one that we should learn to apply to ourselves and others. Sometimes we might entirely disagree with someone, sometimes there may have a been critical failure in an organisation, and some times people may have experienced challenging situations. In these contexts and may more, being **curious** about the reality and lived experience of the situation and meeting it with **compassion** rather than negativity will result in a more productive meeting, and a safer space.

- **Knowledge**: Knowledge is something we all have, we are lived experience experts and we should seek to share our knowkedge and learn from others in room. 

I find the metaphor of a rock is also helpful. For stakeholder meetings the rock represents: a strong base from which to support, challenge and buld for the future.
