If Ken's job in the recent [Barbie (2023)](https://youtu.be/4VWftr1TwbQ?si=re8YAcri8yYx7RxV "YouTube of "My Job is beach"") movie was "beach", then my job is "disability". Or at least it feels that way. A firm believer in the social model of disability, I bring lived experience of physical disability, neurodiversity, mental ill-health and financial trauma to all the work that I do. In that regard I wear, and have worn, many figerative and literal hats in my life: many of them purple.

I have worked for many years to bring a pragmatic and persuasive disability voice to work in to fields such as hate crime, new technologies, public transport, healthcare systems, social security and the law. These and other projects have always been approached through the lens of my lived experience. Actually, that is not entirely true: 

- There was time in my life when, despite having been born with cerebal palsy and other 		physical disabilities. I did not identify as disabled.

- There was a time in my life when I did not, and could not, acknowledge my relationship 		with my own physical and mental health. I did not identify as disabled, nor as having 			experience of mental illness (in fact I prefer the term mental ill-health).

- There was a time in my life when I did not understand the nature of my own 					neurodiversity and the impact it was having on my life. I did not identify as disabled, 		nor as having experience of mental illness, nor did I identify as neurodivergant. 

- There was a time in my life when I was unable to see the reality of my financial situation, and appreciate the impact that it was having on me and those around me. I did not identify as disabled. I did not identify as disabled, nor as having experience of mental illness, nor did I identify as neurodivergant, nor did I recognise the realities of financial trauma around me.

These four elements of my disability profile are each part of me, and have each had an impact on my life in different ways: some good, some bad, all challenging.

In addition, to my lived experience expertise. I am polymath and I like to learn. Among other things I have studied law, politics, social science, philosophy, bioethics, psychoanalysis, psychology and business. I like to write poetry and play board games. I love to read, but for many years a combination of mental ill-health and neurodiversity made this very difficult; if not impossible. I like to write, but for the same reasons at times I have struggled to be productive. 

I like to talk. And I like to listen.

There have been times in my life where I have felt like my life was saved by my therapist. And to that end I have begun a **Doctorate in Counselling Psychology and Psychotherapy** at the Metanoia Institute and Middlesex University.

Additionally, I'm have recenlty completed the accademic stages of the **ILM Level 7 Diploma in Executive Coaching and Mentoring**. I am pleased to be able to offer my unique blend of lived experience and polymath learning to others in the form of coaching or co-thinking. I enjoyed my time as a social entrapreneur, but I can not fully express the sense of isolation that I experienced running while running my own business. I remember a close friend once described me as "seeming alone in a busy room". I know I made mistakes. The results of those mistakes are well documented. It is only now, as I have studied psychology and business, psychoanalysis, counselling psychology and coaching that I have come to fully understand the realities of that was happening at that time, and how I and those around me were experiencing things. I often wonder if things might have been different if I had been prepared to acknowledge my vulnerability at that time and ask for help sooner. I certainly, feel that having access to a coach would have made a difference.

In addition to general executive coaching, my unique approach to Psychology Informed Coaching when coupled with my lived experience and wider traing allows me to have a second specialism in neurodiversity, ADHD, and disability coaching (once again, my job is "disability").

In either case it is my goal to empower individuals and organisations to reach their full potential. I am currently enrolling new clients in both my general executive coaching and neurodiversity, ADHD, and disability coaching practices. Please get in touch if you would like to explore the posibility of working together.

Beyond coaching, I offer **consultancy, training and speaking services** within the disability field. My diverse background and personal story bring depth and authenticity to my presentations and collaborations. If you're looking to engage a passionate and knowledgeable speaker, trainer or consultant, please get in touch.
