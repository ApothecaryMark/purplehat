title: 'Coaching & Mentoring: A Psychology Informed Approach'
order: 1
---
I draw on my interdisciplinary training and lived experience to create a unique psychology informed coaching model.

Within the context of **executive coaching and mentoring** I am comfortable working with a wide range of life, work and wellbeing situations. I blend psychological, psychodynamic and executive coaching techniques to put the person at the centre of a relational model. This might also involve group, family or organisational coaching.

**Whether you are looking for a coaching psychologist, executive coach or mentor please get in touch [via email](mailto:mark@innovationinsociety.com) or [the contact form](#contact) to start a conversation.**

In addition, I welcome the opportunity to work with neurodiversity, specific learning difficulties, and other constructs of disability within the coaching frame. I would be comfortable with the additional title of **ADHD coach**, but I find it slightly restrictive. ADHD is not the only form of neurodiversity that can benefit from the co-thinking approaches of psychology informed coaching. 

**Whether you are looking for a coaching psychologist, ADHD coach, neurodiversity coach, disability coach or mentor please get in touch [via email](mailto:mark@innovationinsociety.com) or [the contact form](#contact) to start a conversation.**

I collaborate with a diverse range of practitioners including coaches, psychotherapists, hypnotherapists, psychologists, counsellors, consultants, trainers, mentors, advocates and activists. If we are not the right fit, or I am not the right practitioner for you, I will happily signpost or refer you on if appropriate.
